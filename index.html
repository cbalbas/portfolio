				<h2>Hello and Welcome!</h2>
				<img src="img/Portrait_300.jpg" align="left" hspace=15px vspace=10px />
				<p>
				My name is Cassandra Balbas, and I’m a graphic designer from Anaheim, California.
				<br><br>
				I have 4+ years of design experience and have collaborated with large organizations including ASUCI, Student Housing, Bite the Ballot, and UK Youth. I have lead marketing campaigns, created graphics for websites, worked on digital and printed publications, and developed UI/ UX designs for mobile and web applications. (I'm more than excited to say that I'm now on my way to designing websites, with this being my first one!) When designing, I usually gravitate toward creating illustrations with the pen tool on Illustrator. I love experimenting with color, depicting motion in projects, and keeping up with design trends. In terms of my  career path, I'm not too sure which route I'll take, (UI/ UX, graphic design, animation) but I am certain that I want to help others through art and creativity. 
				<br><br>
				On my free time, I enjoy doodling, going on food adventures, re-watching Gilmore Girls on Netflix, walking around Barnes and Noble or the dollar section at Target, and spending time with Liwanag, the Filipino Catholic Community on campus.

			<h3>User Research</h3>
				<h4>User Interviews</h4>
				<p> From my conducted interviews, I gained a better understanding of what my users expected from my portfolio, which was to keep it clean, simple, easy to use, and updated with relevant content. The questions I asked were geared toward expectations of the site, its strong suits, and what needed improvement. I was able to get insight from a prospective ICS student in high school, a current college student with their own portfolio, and a UCI alum who has recent hiring experience.

				</p>

				<h4>Competitor Analysis</h4>
				<p> A competitor analysis is research done by the designer so that they are able to see how their work compares to those in the same field. It is an opportunity to grow and improve their websites. I chose my three competitors based off of the content and layout of their portfolios- two of them were graphic designers, one who is also just starting her career and another who has been in the industry for some time, and the other did a great job of only including important information on his site. 
				<br>

				</p>

				<h4>Feature Value Matrix</h4>
				<p> The feature value matrix is a tool used by developers to help analyze and prioritize the features in their site. All features are matched with values that are affected by business value and development effort; the matrix becomes a tool for developers to measure the overall value of each of their features. Because of this tool, they are able to keep only the most important features on their website.
				<br>

				</p>

				<h4>Feature Prioritization</h4>
				<p> The feature value matrix being a numeric measurement tool to rank features, while the feature prioritization becomes a visual representation of these measurements. On this tool, I ranked my features from lowest to highest priority, which helped to plan the next steps of developing my portfolio.

			<h3>User Testing</h3>
				<h4>User Stories</h4>
				<p> User Stories are important because it allows us to look at our sites through a different perspective, with different expectations and assumptions. Most of my user stories involved looking at my website from a hiring manager (which is assumedly also a first-time viewer)’s point of view. I wanted to force myself to look at my site through this lens since I am looking to publish this site as my official portfolio in the near future. 				
				<br>

				</p>

				<h4>Cognitive Walkthroughs</h4>
				<p> A cognitive walkthrough is when the developer asks a user to complete tasks on the site as they record as much information as possible. The outcomes of this part of the final were some of the most beneficial because I believe I got genuine feedback, and was able to record immediate reactions. This was also a chance for my users to ask any questions they had as well. 
				<br>

				</p>

				<h4>User Test</h4>
				<p> 
				The two tests that I did were the question and click test on UsabilityHub. After conducting my user interviews, I became wary that it wouldn’t have been clear for first time users that my site was in fact a portfolio. And so for the question test, I provided a screenshot of the top of my portfolio (with my header and about information) and asked what they would find on the site. Many of testers said they’d find my projects, but there were some that said they expected to find photography, photos of nature, and just my autobiography alone.
				<br>
				In addition to this, I chose to conduct a click test to see if my users would be able to find the link that would open a dialogue box to type an email to me. I included an entire screenshot of my site, and so many of my testers did not know they would scroll. I will be sure to indicate this the next time I create a click test on UsabilityHub. However, even with the mistake I realized that I do need to make the link more obvious.

			<br>
			<h3>Summary of Findings</h3>
			<p> The overall research process was enlightening. I benefited greatly from the interviews and the tests created on UsabilityHub because it gave me the opportunity to get direct user content and feedback. It also allowed me to get out of my comfort zone and ask people to test my work, which was a phase of the process that I’ve dreaded doing in all my classes.
			<br><br>
			I believe that the biggest challenge I faced in the testing was trying to find people who have never used my site to eliminate any to get authentic feedback. This affected me most while I was working on my cognitive walkthroughs and UsabilityHub tests; I was worried that because many of my friends knew that I was developing a portfolio, that that would have affected their answers. However, I ended up getting more feedback than I thought I would, especially with the click and question tests, which I plan to implement in the future. 
			<br><br>
			Overall, from the entire experience I was able to gain a better understanding of my users as well as what I needed to work on. Many of them liked the simplicity of my portfolio, but were still thrown off by a few designs that they’ve grown accustomed to because of conventions. Lastly, I feel that this overall process has motivated me to keep working on my site- whether it be from gaining inspiration from analyzing my competitors’ websites, from the positive feedback I had received from loved ones, or the fact that I was learning so much, I am excited to see how far I can take my portfolio as well as how far it can take me too.

			<h3>Incorporation of Findings</h3>
			<p>
			As mentioned earlier, I hope to apply everything I’ve learned from my findings to improve my website. Based off of my cognitive walkthroughs, my future development plans include having my pictures be clickable, where users will be able to access higher quality photos of my work, to keep working on just one page, and to work on my header image.
			<br><br>
			In one of my cognitive walkthroughs, one of my testers pointed out that the image of the caterpillar was “random”. This point correlated with the results of my question test on UsabilityHub, where I asked what people expected from the site, based on the top portion of my page alone: I received a few comments saying that they expected nature photos and a photographer’s portfolio. My header image was also put as a low priority in my feature value matrix because it only had a decorative purpose. For future development plans of my website, I will be prioritizing creating a header image that better represents me and that can also be more purposeful. 
			<br><br>
			Overall, the users were able to navigate through the site easily, finding nearly everything that I asked them to in a short amount of time.
